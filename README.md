# If you use these codes, please cite our paper:
X. Zhou, Y. Wang, Q. Zhu. A fast and robust visual detection method for glass bottle body with binary template matching. In CCC, 2019. (under review)

This example is implemented using C++ and has been tested on Windows 10 (64 bit) system with Visual Studio 2012. And the OpenCV library (https://opencv.org/) is needed.

The tested images and detection results are saved in the folders "inputImages" and "detResults", respectively.  The templates of the bottle body and neck are named "198_tmB.png" and "198_tmN.png", respectively in the same folder with the main file, which is named "mainLocBody.cpp", please run the main file and press any key to continue running.
